My personal [water quality specialist](WQS.md) (water offered by me; distilled, +filtered well water, +onTapWater), service dog Smiley was luered multiple times and successfully dognapped on January 1st 2021 while playing in his yard. He luered and abducted by people who moved in next door last spring.  This great puppy is now missing.  He was a great language learner, a beautiful beginner coder, and skilled worker at age 15 weeks old when he was luered and abducted.  Can you please assist?

Why was Smiley a great water quality specialist?
1.  He would not forge data like city employed personel did!  Why were the forging personel set free @nocost?  Is this why my friend canine Smiley is not at my side?
1.  He would NOT drink tainted water.  He would drink good water.

1.  Ensure that all of the dog's bowls are made of glass.
1.  Fill the bowls with different kinds of water, including tap and bottled water.  Also fill a bowl with whole milk (Michigan PBB milk contamination incident) and more glass bowls with dog (dry and wet) and human food.
