My personal [water quality specialist](https://serviceanimals.github.io/Smiley/WQS) (water offered by me; distilled, +filtered well water, +onTapWater), service dog Smiley was luered multiple times and successfully dognapped on Sunday, January 3rd 2021 while playing in his yard. He was luered and successfully abducted by people who moved in next door last spring in 2020.  This great service animal puppy is now missing.  He was a great language learner, a beautiful beginner coder, and skilled worker at age 15 weeks old when he was luered and successfully abducted.  Can you please assist?
